                    We started with a topic: sports and from there we worked the double diamond design process in UX: research, define, ideate and prototype (and repeat) for 6 months.</br>

            <h2>Context</h2></p>
            <p class="paragraph-long">From the outset, my team focused on solving a social problem, so we considered people that had issues with sports. We thought of professional female athletes who have to work twice as hard to get their achievements rewarded not only financially but also by the media.</br>
            </br>
                On a daily level, (where we actually wanted to act), we asked ourselves <b>Why do women play sports?</b> According to the National Survey on Sports Habits only 47.5% of women do sports regularly and mainly for health reasons and in order to get a perfect body shape. There is also a clear trend in sports chosen by both genders: while women opt for aerobics, men choose endurance and leadership sports.</br>
            </br>    
                A worrying fact is that girls practice less sport than boys in Spain. It is in their teen years when they quit due to a lack of motivation and female role models mainly.</br>

        <div class="full-paragraph">
            <p class="Title2">
            <h2>The challenge</h2></p>
            <p class="paragraph-long">After gathering all this information we came up with the big question:</br>
                <b>How can we improve women's experiences doing sports?</b></br>
                The research began once the big topics to explore were set. We wanted to dig into concerns, motivations, references, stereotypes, colleagues and coaching staff relationships.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Archetypes</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-long">Firstly, we had to define who investigate. Therefore we set the archetypes, user profiles that would help us to understand them in depth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="full-paragraph">
            <h3>Surveys and interviews</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-long">In order to explore the topic, we conducted a survey to 30 women belonging to the three archetypes and we asked them about the issues above-named.</br>
                We found out that the amateur is directly affected by the other two archetypes and we obtained many more pains to improve from them, so we decided to set her as the main archetype. Also, she was the most achievable profile and we would reach many more users. Then we start with the interviews and we were lucky to speak with 13 women.

            <h2>Insights</h2></p>
            <p class="paragraph-long">Both amateurs and professionals believe that the trainer's presence is very important, and most of them highlight that they truly connect with woman coaches.
                Amateurs also have a strong bond with their colleagues: there is a very positive energy in team sports or in group classes among women and they empower each other. 
                When we interviewed women who box or lift weight, they claim that there is a lack of knowledge and prejudices by men and women.</br>
                </br>
                Specialists emphasize that many learners come to train with fear or thinking they cannot perform certain exercises. They believe that there are still stereotypes and mistaken ideas like their muscles might grow a lot if they train with weight.</br>
                </br>
                The professionals highlight the lack of interest from the media on their work and the stereotypes that still exist in sports traditionally considered male like football or boxing.

                        When the insights were sorted, we set a user persona according our main archetype, thus it helped us to arrange and understand their habits.

            <p class="paragraph-long"><b>Olympias</b> is a web-app that empowers women through sport. A community based platform where women can grow and evolve in sport encouraging each other.</br>

                The aim is to make them aware they are able to play any sport and to achieve whatever they want.</br>
                
                With the claim <b>Train like a woman</b>, we take a stand on feminism, gender equality and sorority. Our philosophy plays a key role in the content, always related to cheer up women, although men can also take part in Olympias.</br>
