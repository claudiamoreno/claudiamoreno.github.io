            <h2>Context</h2></p>
            <p class="paragraph-long">From the outset, my team focused on solving a social problem, so we considered people that had issues with sports. We thought of professional female athletes who have to work twice as hard to get their achievements rewarded not only financially but also by the media.</br>
            </br>
                On a daily level, (where we actually wanted to act), we asked ourselves <b>Why do women play sports?</b> According to the Spanish National Survey on Sports Habits only 47.5% of women do sports regularly and mainly for health reasons and in order to get a perfect body shape. There is also a clear trend in sports chosen by both genders: while women opt for aerobics, men choose endurance and leadership sports.

                </div>

        
            <p class="paragraph-long">
            A worrying fact is that girls practice less sport than boys in Spain. It is in their teen years when they quit due to a lack of motivation and female role models mainly.</p>

            <h2>The challenge</h2></p>
            <p class="paragraph-long">After gathering all this information we came up with the big question:</br>
            <b>How can we improve women's experiences doing sports?</b></br>
            </br>
                The research began once the big topics to explore were set. We wanted to dig into concerns, motivations, references, stereotypes, colleagues and coaching staff relationships.

            <h3 class="subtitle">Archetypes</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-long">Firstly, we had to define who investigate. Therefore we set the archetypes, user profiles that would help us to understand them in depth.

            <h3 class="subtitle">Surveys and interviews</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-long">In order to explore the topic, we conducted a survey to 30 women belonging to the three archetypes and we asked them about the issues above-named.</br>
                We found out that the amateur is directly affected by the other two archetypes and we obtained many more pains to improve from them, so we decided to set her as the main archetype. Also, she was the most achievable profile and we would reach many more users. Then we start with the interviews and we were lucky to speak with 13 women.

            <p class="paragraph-long">Both amateurs and professionals believe that the trainer's presence is key, and most of them highlight that they truly connect with woman coaches.
                Amateurs also have a strong bond with their colleagues: there is a very positive energy in team sports or in group classes among women and they empower each other. 
                When we interviewed women who box or lift weight, they claim that there is a lack of knowledge and prejudices by men and women towards these sort of sports.</br>
                </br>
                Specialists emphasize that many learners come to train with fear or thinking they cannot perform certain exercises. They believe that there are still stereotypes and mistaken ideas like their muscles might grow a lot if they train with weight.</br>
                </br>
                The professionals highlight the lack of interest from the media on their work and the stereotypes that still exist in sports traditionally considered male like football or boxing.

                            Including a <b>chat</b> to text either olympias or the captain, in these small communities athletes can help each other.

                The captain is in charge of coach olympias and manage the community as well. To keep their trainees motivated, they also create challenges. Depending on the sport involved, challenges are <b>motivational exercises</b> that captains choose. They are displayed by difficulty and olympias can decide to sign up.</br>
                In the challenge, they will find a video tutorial or multimedia content, step-by-step of the exercises and tips to carry it out. Once finished, it can be marked as done.

                In order to make challenges more interesting we add a key component: <b>gamification</b>. Thus, performing steps within the web-app, they can unlock <b>badges</b>. For example, taking the first challenge unlocks the 1st challenge medal, and olympias can see all those who have unlocked or have pending in the medal section in their profile.

                Captains are the group leaders and manage their olympia's community. They have <b>great sports skills</b>, leadership attitude and always willing to help. Main tasks are chat moderating and challenges uploading.

            <p class="paragraph-long">
                Captain has different needs than olympias. It is a profile that seeks to promote their classes, make themselves known or increase followers on their social media. That is why in the Profile section, unlike the Olympias, they can add their instagram or facebook, upcoming face-to-face classes or new Meetup events in order to get new trainees.

            <p class="paragraph-long">
                In our corporate website the applicant can make the captain request filling out a form. Olympia's administration department would check if they have minimal knowledge of the discipline they want to form the group. If so, we will send them a link by e-mail to complete the process :)

                Our roles have different features in Olympias, but there are sections that both captains and olympias share.</br>

                <b>Onboarding</b>: When users access Olympias for the first time, we explain our product's benefits and how the platform works.</br>
                
                <b>Login</b>: It is when olympias want to join a group that we ask them to create an account. Before this step we do not force them to register. We rather prefer them browsing and exploring so that they can get to know us and gain confidence. </br>
                
                <b>Home</b>: The home screen is the first one we show. It is a section that aims to be an overview of the app. It shows news about groups, captains and stories and when the user signs up, we personalize the experience with a progress message about their challenges.</br>

                <b>Stories</b>: Stories are the informative part within the web-app, not only have an actuality intention, but also education purposes. They are small articles shaped in Instagram stories that deal with women's sport and everything that involves it. In this way we manage to break down stereotypes and give women's sport the importance it deserves.</br>
                
                <b>Browser</b>: Users can search for groups by sport or city. As one of our objectives is that women discover new sports, we include some cards in order to show all our sporting provision. Thanks to tests, we saw that in this way users explored the categories and groups easily.</br>
                
                <b>My groups</b>: Also in tests, olympias and captains tend to search groups that have already joined through the navigation bar, so we add My groups. In the upper tab they can go to their group chats.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-long">
                The goal in our master's final project was to develop a digital product through an <b>incremental iterative process</b>. In fact, we started the project with stories as the value proposal, but we realised that we were not solving the whole problem. Once we saw mentoring was the app core, we elaborated a roadmap where we started with the most important functionalities first  and completed and improved them in the following deliveries.</br>
                </br>
                From the first moment, <b>user tests</b> have been our way of validating  functionalities, flows, interface design and content. We carried out on-site tests for the first release, then, due to the lockdown, we carried out the rest remotely. Validate with users allowed us to make key decisions. Giving more visual weight to the platform than we had initially planned, adding My Groups to the navigation bar so that the olympics would have them at hand, or the classification of sports in the browser section are some examples.</br>

                The whole process of Olympias was a journey at the same time for us. The most difficult thing for our team, especially at the beginning, was to work and think in <b>agile</b> methodology, so that since the first release our product would work on its own and deliver value.</br>
                </br>
                However, <b>working remotely</b> during the quarantine was very easy and comfortable for us. By our second release Olympias was very advanced and my colleagues and I became very skilled with Figma: we worked with components and created a design system.</br>
